Hi, Iâ€™m Peter. I am an Investment Analyst and am interested in developing useful applications for portfolio managment and research opperations.
I have experience with Python, VBA and R however, I would not concider myself a coding expert.
I have an MBA from the University of Alabama and am hoping to one day hold a CFA designation.
