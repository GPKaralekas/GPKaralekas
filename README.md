Hi, Iâ€™m Peter. Iâ€™m interested in finance and portfolio management.
I have been learning how to implement python to aid in the analysis of complex financial problems. I have experience with Python, VBA and R however, I am far from a coding expert.
I have an MBA from the University of Alabama and am hoping to one day hold a CFA designation.
